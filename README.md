# Problem set solutions

This repository contains the my solutions to the 2019 Problem Set for the Module Programming and Scripting at GMIT.
[The instructions can be found here] https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/problems-pands-2019/raw/master/problems.pdf

I worked on the first few problems until I had them perfected, so I am not really showing my steps in figuring out the solution because of that. I changed this method as soon as I read that this was the wrong way go go about it.
