# Problem set solutions


This repository contains the my solutions to the 2019 Problem Set for the Module Programming and Scripting at GMIT.
[The instructions can be found here] https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/problems-pands-2019/raw/master/problems.pdf



I worked on the first few problems until I had them perfected, so I am not really showing my steps in figuring out the solution because of that. 
I changed this method as soon as I read that this was the wrong way go go about it.

#Problem 10: 
It took me a while to figure out how to plot the functions of x. I had to look online for some clues to get me started. I found a tutorial on https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/usage.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-usage-py that really helped me on my way.
