## Each of the 10 files in this repository contains my solutions to set of problems:

#### Problem 1: "Enter a positive integer and calculate the sum of all numbers between one and the integer entered."

#### Problem 2: "Display if today begins with the letter T."
![Problem2screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47186083/54874376-0696bb00-4de2-11e9-9f50-fe429b43ca21.png)
#### Problem 3: "Print all numbers between 1000 and 10000, that are divisible by 6, but not by 12."
![Problem3screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47186083/54874377-07c7e800-4de2-11e9-90ab-250a6cbe1d8d.png)
#### Problem 4: "Asks user for a positive integer. then output the successive value. If current value is even, then it is divided by 2. If current value is odd, it is multiplied by 3 and 1 is added. If current value is 1, the program ends."
![Problem4screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47186083/54874379-08f91500-4de2-11e9-97ce-e90d423b355d.png)
#### Problem 5: "Ask user for a positive integer and tell user if it is a prime number."
![Problem5screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47186083/54874380-0a2a4200-4de2-11e9-9678-a232dedc34c1.png)
#### Problem 6: "This program takes a user input string and outputs every second word."
![Problem6screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47186083/54874381-0c8c9c00-4de2-11e9-92fc-b756ad8d4cd2.png)
#### Problem 7: "Take a positive floating point number and return an approximation of it's square root"
![Problem7screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47186083/54874382-0e565f80-4de2-11e9-9efe-0d340e9f3922.png)
#### Problem 8: "This program outputs today's date and time."
![Problem8screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47186083/54874383-10202300-4de2-11e9-9575-d47870c6540d.png)
#### Problem 9: "This program reads in a text ﬁle and outputs every second line. The program will take the ﬁlename from an argument on the command line."
![Problem9screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47186083/54874385-11515000-4de2-11e9-8e15-9980d6f70dc0.png)
#### Problem 10: "This program will display a plot of the functions x, x*x and 2**x, in the range[0,4]"
![Plot of functions x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47186083/54874387-12827d00-4de2-11e9-93ff-9c3c666ab20e.png)


#### I worked on the first few problems until I had them perfected, and then uploaded them to Github, so I am not really showing my steps in figuring out the solution. I changed this method for the later problems, as soon as I read that this was the wrong way go go about it.
