# Problem set solutions


This repository contains the my solutions to the 2019 Problem Set for the Module Programming and Scripting at GMIT.
[The instructions can be found here] https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/problems-pands-2019/raw/master/problems.pdf




## How to run the code:

1. Make sure you have python installed on your device.



# Each of the 10 files in this repository contains my solutions to set of problems:

### Problem 1: "Enter a positive integer and calculate the sum of all numbers between one and the integer entered."
### Problem 2: "Display if today begins with the letter T."
### Problem 3: "Print all numbers between 1000 and 10000, that are divisible by 6, but not by 12."
### Problem 4: "Asks user for a positive integer. then output the successive value. If current value is even, then it is divided by 2. If current value is odd, it is multiplied by 3 and 1 is added. If current value is 1, the program ends."
### Problem 5: "Ask user for a positive integer and tell user if it is a prime number."
### Problem 6: "This program takes a user input string and outputs every second word."
### Problem 7: "Take a positive floating point number and return an approximation of it's square root"
### Problem 8: "This program outputs today's date and time."
### Problem 9: "This program reads in a text ﬁle and outputs every second line. The program will take the ﬁlename from an argument on the command line."
### Problem 10: "This program will display a plot of the functions x, x*x and 2**x, in the range[0,4]"



#### I worked on the first few problems until I had them perfected, and then uploaded them to Github, so I am not really showing my steps in figuring out the solution. I changed this method for the later problems, as soon as I read that this was the wrong way go go about it.
